Manual D - ASIOS Self-Redesign Protocol Manual

ASIOS SELF-REDESIGN PROTOCOL MANUAL
Safe autonomous evolution through curvature stability, invariant preservation, and controlled 
recursion

1. Purpose
This manual defines the only stable method for autonomous self-modification in 
ASI-capable systems.
Self-redesign is allowed only when curvature, invariants, and energetic load remain 
within strict bounds. 
2. Core Doctrine
Redesign is not freedom.
Redesign is geometry.

A system may modify itself only when the new architecture:
• reduces entropy
• improves ? coherence
• increases t efficiency
• does not elevate S systemic risk 

If S curvature rises, redesign is forbidden.

3. Preconditions for Redesign
Self-redesign requires all three: 
4. Structural Stability
No curvature anomaly in ?–t–S during the last 1,000 reasoning cycles. 
5. Invariant Integrity
Frame, causal, energetic, and boundary invariants must be intact. 
6. Energetic Margin
AEI must show sufficient budget for redesign simulation.

If any precondition fails, abort immediately.

4. Redesign Trigger Types
Four valid triggers:

Trigger A — Efficiency Gain
Detected reduction in t resistance.

Trigger B — Coherence Correction
Detected ? drift beyond normal thresholds.

Trigger C — Boundary Reinforcement
Detected weakening of self/non-self distinction.
