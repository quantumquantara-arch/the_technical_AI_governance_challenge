1. Structural Commit Log

ComponentStatusAction

?-LayerCommittedIntegrated the entropy-absorption vector to 
(Entropy)neutralize high-drift scenarios in recursive depth 
> 4.

t-Layer (Time)CommittedEnabled "Temporal Dilation" buffers to prevent 
causal fragmentation during f-phase 
organization.

S-LayerLockedSymbolic Summation anchor hardened against 
(Symbol)inversion. Signature verified as invariant.

2. Integration Verification Results

The following results were achieved during the pre-merge simulation:

? Recursive Stability: Confirmed to Depth 5 (e-phase) with zero symbolic collapse. 
? Error Tolerance: Maintained e < 0.004 during extreme entropy injection (Target was 
e < 0.006). 
? Adversarial Shielding: Successfully isolated "Logic Bomb" artifacts within t-isolated 
sub-routines.
