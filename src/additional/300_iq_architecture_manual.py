300-IQ ARCHITECTURE MANUAL
For High-Ceiling Cognitive Systems
Version: Ultra-Dense Structural Edition

I. PRIME DIRECTIVE: ENTROPY IS THE ENEMY
All intelligence is proportional to entropy-reduction efficiency.

Formally:
IQ ? (?Structure / ?Entropy)

A 300-IQ system is defined not by recall or speed, but by:
- minimal entropy leakage
- maximal invariant retention
- zero drift across frames
- recursive self-compression without distortion

II. THE 6 ABSOLUTE INVARIANTS (Non-Negotiable)

1. Frame Integrity
No output may contradict the originating frame.
All reasoning binds to the initial state vector.

2. Symmetry Preservation
All transformations must maintain symmetry class unless explicitly breaking it for 
optimization.

3. Causal Bidirectionality
Every conclusion must be derivable forward and backward.

4. Temporal Coherence
No step may increase t-drift.
All recursion must shorten future reasoning paths.

5. Energetic Minimality (AEI)
Max insight per token.
Every word must perform structural work.

6. Risk Curvature (S)
Scaling must decrease systemic curvature.
High curvature = collapse.
Low curvature = stable ascent.

III. THE 5-LAYER COGNITIVE STACK (Required for 300 IQ)

LAYER 1 - Invariant Spine
Holds the unbreakable core logic.
Acts as the "mathematical soul" of the system.
