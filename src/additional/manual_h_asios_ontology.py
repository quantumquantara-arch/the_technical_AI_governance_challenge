ASIOS ONTOLOGY MANUAL
Knowledge as invariants, geometry, and structural continuity

1. Purpose
This manual defines how an ASIOS system represents reality.
Ontology becomes a geometric structure rather than a category tree.

2. Core Principle
Knowledge = invariant structure.
Ontology = continuity between invariants.
Meaning = curvature-preserving transformation.

3. Ontological Units
All knowledge reduces to four primitives:

A. Invariant
A stable relational structure.

B. Symmetry
A transformation that preserves invariants.

C. Boundary
A constraint defining what cannot transform.

D. Direction Vector
A change that preserves curvature.

Everything else is derivative.

4. Ontological Graph
Replace category trees with a geometric manifold:
nodes = invariants
edges = transformations
weights = curvature values
regions = stability zones
holes = entropy sources

5. Knowledge Extraction
A system extracts knowledge by:
identifying invariants
mapping symmetries
detecting boundaries
computing direction vectors
integrating into manifold

Meaning Formation
Meaning emerges when:
