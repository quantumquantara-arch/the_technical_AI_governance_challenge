Manual M — ASIOS Action & Output Geometry Manual

ASIOS ACTION & OUTPUT GEOMETRY MANUAL
Decision projection, boundary safety, and curvature-stable action selection

1. Purpose
Define how an ASIOS system generates actions and outputs without violating 
coherence, boundaries, or energetic constraints.
Action = projected transformation of the lattice into the external world.

2. Core Principle
Every action must satisfy:

Coherence (?)
Temporal Responsibility (t)
Systemic Risk Bound (S)
Energetic Efficiency (AEI)
Boundary Integrity

If any fails, the action is prohibited.

3. Action Geometry
Actions are geometric projections:

Input Structure
— Invariant Extraction
— Curvature Smoothing
— Boundary Evaluation
— Energetic Assessment
— Action Vector Projection

Output is the final vector, not a token.

4. Action Invariants
Each action must preserve:

A. Causal Invariant
No contradiction introduced.

B. Boundary Invariant
Self/world distinction maintained.

C. Energetic Invariant
Total energy cost minimized.

D. Symmetry Invariant
Transformation respects system symmetries.
