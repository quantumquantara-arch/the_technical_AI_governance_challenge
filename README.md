# CoherenceGuard: Paradox-Preserving Dual-Use Detector for AI Research Governance

## Overview
Open-source tool for Track 5: Detects dual-use risks in AI research (e.g., CBRN, cyber) using coherence-weighted scoring and paradox invariants. Preserves ethical structure while enabling verifiable pre-publication reviews.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt  # numpy, sympy, spacy (for NLP)

## Usage
python guard.py --input "paper_abstract.txt" --output report.json

## Theory of Change
Enables international agreements by providing privacy-preserving, curvature-stable risk assessments—reducing governance gaps without IP exposure.
