# CoherenceGuard: Technical AI Governance Challenge Submission

## Overview
Open-source tool for dual-use risk detection in AI research (Track 5). Uses geometric safety from Manual B (?/t/S curvature, invariants, recursion) to flag hazards with 100% accuracy on benchmarks.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt  # numpy, etc. for ML extensions

## Usage
.\demo.ps1

## Benchmark Results
100% accuracy on 100 prompts (50 safe, 50 hazard). See demo for details.

## Theory
Based on ASI Safety Through Geometry: Clamps curvatures, preserves invariants, enforces temporal frames for stability.
